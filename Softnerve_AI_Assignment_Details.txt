Artificial Intelligence (AI) Internship Assignment

Objective:
Create an automated book publication workflow using AI with the following steps:

1. Scraping & Screenshots:
   - Fetch content and save screenshots from:
     https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Gates_of_Morning/Book_1/Chapter_1

2. AI Writing & Review:
   - Use LLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4) to rewrite the chapter ("spinning")
   - Then, simulate an AI reviewer to refine the chapter.

3. Human-in-the-Loop:
   - Enable edits and revisions through human interaction (input/review cycles)

4. Agentic API:
   - Ensure smooth flow of content between AI writer, reviewer, and editor.

5. Versioning & Consistency:
   - Use ChromaDB for storing and versioning final content.
   - Implement a RL-based search algorithm for smart content retrieval.

Core Tools:
- Python (Main language)
- Playwright (Web scraping and screenshots)
- LLMs (AI writing, editing)
- ChromaDB (Database for version control)
- RL search algorithm (For content recall and tracking)

Submission:
- Submit your code via a public GitHub repository
- Submit a short recorded video demo
- Deadline: 28 June 2025

Note:
- No commercial use of your code
- AI-generated assignments without real implementation will be rejected
- Plagiarism will lead to disqualification
